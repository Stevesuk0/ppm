## Overview

Plusto Package Manager is a hybrid package manager for Linux, currently supporting the `dpkg` format. We are conducting tests, and future versions are planned to merge various Linux package formats, such as Debian's `.deb`, Fedora's `.rpm`, and others, so that Plusto Package Manager will support a broader range of formats, offering better compatibility and flexibility for different Linux users.
